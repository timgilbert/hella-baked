From [The Perfect Loaf](https://www.theperfectloaf.com/beginners-sourdough-bread/)

- making 1 loaf, 1/2 formula
### Levain, 9:40am:
- 19g starter
- 19g wheat
- 19g bread
- 38g water
- Total: 61g !?, 9:41am 
	- Seems like I lost some mass somewhere?
- ready for mixing 2:40 - 3:40
### Autolyse, 1:40pm:
- 387g bread
- 57g whole wheat
- 26g dark rye
- 304g water
- Save 25g water
### Mix, 2:40pm
- 25g water (I added about 14g, warm as the autolyse is cold, still seems like maybe too much)
- 9g salt
- 85g levain
	- May add a bit more raw starter to compensate here
	- levian back up to 95g
- Auto is 74F
### Bulk ferment, 2:50pm - 6:50pm
- Stretch and fold 3 times spaced out 30 mins
- Dough seems a little wet. Possibly too cold? Moved it into the oven with the warming drawer going (medium) after 2nd fold, 4:00ish.
- I'm worried I didn't mix it thoroughly enough, I just kind of folded the new stuff into the autolyse.
### Preshape, shape
- starting 30 mins early (book club) - total bulk ferment ~3hr30min vs 4 hrs
- disaster
	- Way too gelatinous, no structure
	- Just took it out of the oven on warming. Too cold? Did I mess up the hydration?
	- Current plan: put in the fridge for a bit, try to pre-shape again after book club
		- In fridge, 6:33
		- Out, 8:24
		- 2 more folds. 8:40
		- Rest 30 mins, tried again to shape.  The dough is like sticky Jell-O. No dice. Put it back in the fridge. Maybe tomorrow? But I may need to start over.
### Proof in fridge
### Results
- Never did rise or be able to be shaped. Baked it anyways in the dutch oven. Good texture, taste, crust. Low, squat loaf. Not bad crumb, though.
