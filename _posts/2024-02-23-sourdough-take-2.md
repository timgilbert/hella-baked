## Log
- used all purpose vs bread flour for levain, oops
- levain weight is correct
- levain on schedule at 11am
- pre-weighed the flour for autolyse, just add water
- autolyse looks good, water temp 78F, autolyse temp 78.8F after mixing
	- Still not sure how vigorously to mix the autolyse
- mix: 19g water. Seems less sloppy than last time. Finished at 4:10.
- pre-shape: 8:30. Fairly strong dough, no bubbles however.
- Shape, 9pm. Decent-looking boule. a few surface bubbles.
- Going to try proofing in a metal bowl with a bit of olive oil to stop from sticking
- Oven has a "proof" setting - unfortunately, it's 100F minimum
- Proofed in oven at above for 20 mins, in the fridge at 9:30pm.
	- Tomorrow: preheat 12:30, bake 1:00pm, cool 1:50pm, eat 2:50-3:50pm.
- Shaped loaf:

# Result
- Decent structure. Round was a little wonky and off-kilter, but basically the right shape. Good oven spring. 
  ![baked](../assets/images/full/2024-02-23/baked.jpg)
- Crust: excellent! A tad hard to cut on the bottom though.
- Crumb: not great? 
  ![sliced](../assets/images/full/2024-02-23/sliced.jpg)
	- A few big holes, mostly pretty dense, sandwichy crumb
	- A few gummy spots where it looks like the bread didn't cook long enough
	- Didn't measure temp when I took it out
	- Possibly I messed this up by trying to do some post-proof reshaping to get it into more of a ball at the end.
- Maybe bake at 475 for first 20 mins next time?
- Flavor: pretty good. Bit of a sourdough-y aftertaste. Could be sourer.
