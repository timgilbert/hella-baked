From [Pantry Mama](https://www.pantrymama.com/sourdough-pumpernickel-bread/)

- pretty tough to shape, v. sticky. Managed to get it somewhat boule-ish with a bench scraper.
- Had no malt. Used leftover coffee but only had 210g, used water for the rest
- Proof in fridge starting at 11:30.
- Added (toasted) caraway seeds to the initial autolyse (didn't add the salt until stretch+fold 1)

## Results
- Nice-looking loaf, if not as tall as I would like. 
- Getting better at scoring, looks pretty.

Crumb could be darker.

Good flavor, and nice sweet smell from the molasses.
