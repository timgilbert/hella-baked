From [King Arthur](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/buttery-sourdough-biscuits-recipe), see [blog here](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/blog/2019/07/19/sourdough-for-breakfast)

- I think I underfolded the dough, there were still lots of floury bits
- No unsalted butter, so I used salted, + kosher salt in same measurements
- Cut with a little round cutter thing. I think I may have incorrectly twisted a time or two. I didn't flour the cutter and the biscuits stuck to it.

# Results

Failure!

- Zero rise, these are more like flour-flavored cookies.
- Flavor is pleasantly wheaty, at least, and I can taste the sourdough.
- Crunchy in a way that would be good on the outside of a biscuit, but zero pillowy softness within.
- May try without sourdough next to get the hang of regular biscuits.

I wonder if my baking powder has gone bad?
