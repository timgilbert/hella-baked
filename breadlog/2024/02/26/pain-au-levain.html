<meta name="description" content="https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/pain-au-levain-recipe Going to try making a batard here, also making the full recipe for 2 loaves Levain    My starter was slightly tired-looking, hope everything is cool   Surprisingly stiff   Started at 4:30pm. For a 12 hour ferment, that’s not a great schedule. May refrigerate for a few hours to slow it down.      Dough      Seems ok. First fold at 45 minutes (12:30pm).   Didn’t oil bowl, dough stuck a bit   Left to rise a little longer than recipe calls for (~3 hours)     Pre-shape, shape      Divided dough a little unevenly   Made my bâtard premiere   Batard is the smaller one. Put it in the fridge to retard, 3:45pm   The big guy I made into a boule, proofing on counter, should be ready for baking around 5:45     Baking      Will the batard fit in our larger dutch oven?     Boule      Good oven spring! Scored a little too deeply and got a sort of flap coming up on one side.   20 minutes with cover on in dutch oven   28 minutes cover off (checked at 20, not quite dark enough). Outer crust looks good but slightly burnt on the bottom   Internal temp 210F   Cooling for 1hr30   9pm - cut. Not bad! Better crumb than last time, no gummy bits. Cooled for ~2+ hours.     Results     Best yet! Spongy, wheaty, nice taste. Awesome toasted. Not tons of tang/sourness, but still delicious. Maybe the bâtard will be more sour?     Bâtard      Shape wound up a bit lumpy and short, maybe need to score it in a crescent next time and taper it more   Again, baked for 20 mins w/steam, 28 minutes without. Put on parchment on a baking stone.   Used a 9x9” glass pan with towels + the cast-iron bottom of the dutch oven + boiling water for steam            Not quite as dark as the boule, but also not burned on the bottom">
