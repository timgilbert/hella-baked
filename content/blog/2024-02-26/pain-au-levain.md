Going to try making a batard here, also making the full recipe for 2 loaves
# Levain
- My starter was slightly tired-looking, hope everything is cool
- Surprisingly stiff
- Started at 4:30pm. For a 12 hour ferment, that's not a great schedule. May refrigerate for a few hours to slow it down.

# Dough
- Seems ok. First fold at 45 minutes (12:30pm).
- Didn't oil bowl, dough stuck a bit
- Left to rise a little longer than recipe calls for (~3 hours)
# Pre-shape, shape
- Divided dough a little unevenly
- Made my _bâtard premiere_
- Batard is the smaller one. Put it in the fridge to retard, 3:45pm
- The big guy I made into a boule, proofing on counter, should be ready for baking around 5:45
# Baking
- Will the batard fit in our larger dutch oven?
## Boule
- Good oven spring! Scored a little too deeply and got a sort of flap coming up on one side.
- 20 minutes with cover on in dutch oven
- 28 minutes cover off (checked at 20, not quite dark enough). Outer crust looks good but slightly burnt on the bottom
- Internal temp 210F
- Cooling for 1hr30
- 9pm - cut. Not bad! Better crumb than last time, no gummy bits. Cooled for ~2+ hours.
### Results
Best yet! Spongy, wheaty, nice taste. Awesome toasted. Not tons of tang/sourness, but still delicious. Maybe the bâtard will be more sour?
## Bâtard
- Shape wound up a bit lumpy and short, maybe need to score it in a crescent next time and taper it more
- Again, baked for 20 mins w/steam, 28 minutes without. Put on parchment on a baking stone.
- Used a 9x9" glass pan with towels + the cast-iron bottom of the dutch oven + boiling water for steam
	- Not quite as dark as the boule, but also not burned on the bottom
