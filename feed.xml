Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll serve</code>, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.</p>

<p>Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP</code></p>

<p>Where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEAR</code> is a four-digit number, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MONTH</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DAY</code> are both two-digit numbers, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MARKUP</code> is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.</p>

<p>Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Hi, </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">"</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
<span class="n">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'Tom'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1">#=&gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.</span></code></pre></figure>

Going to try making a batard here, also making the full recipe for 2 loaves</p>
<h1 id="levain">Levain</h1>
<ul>
  <li>My starter was slightly tired-looking, hope everything is cool</li>
  <li>Surprisingly stiff</li>
  <li>Started at 4:30pm. For a 12 hour ferment, that’s not a great schedule. May refrigerate for a few hours to slow it down.
<img src="/assets/images/2024-02-26/levain.jpg" alt="levain" />
    <h1 id="dough">Dough</h1>
  </li>
  <li>Seems ok. First fold at 45 minutes (12:30pm).</li>
  <li>Didn’t oil bowl, dough stuck a bit</li>
  <li>Left to rise a little longer than recipe calls for (~3 hours)
    <h1 id="pre-shape-shape">Pre-shape, shape</h1>
  </li>
  <li>Divided dough a little unevenly</li>
  <li>Made my <em>bâtard premiere</em></li>
  <li>Batard is the smaller one. Put it in the fridge to retard, 3:45pm</li>
  <li>The big guy I made into a boule, proofing on counter, should be ready for baking around 5:45
    <h1 id="baking">Baking</h1>
  </li>
  <li>Will the batard fit in our larger dutch oven?
    <h2 id="boule">Boule</h2>
  </li>
  <li>Good oven spring! Scored a little too deeply and got a sort of flap coming up on one side.</li>
  <li>20 minutes with cover on in dutch oven</li>
  <li>28 minutes cover off (checked at 20, not quite dark enough). Outer crust looks good but slightly burnt on the bottom</li>
  <li>Internal temp 210F</li>
  <li>Cooling for 1hr30</li>
  <li>9pm - cut. Not bad! Better crumb than last time, no gummy bits. Cooled for ~2+ hours.
    <h3 id="results">Results</h3>
    <p>Best yet! Spongy, wheaty, nice taste. Awesome toasted. Not tons of tang/sourness, but still delicious. Maybe the bâtard will be more sour?</p>
    <h2 id="bâtard">Bâtard</h2>
  </li>
  <li>Shape wound up a bit lumpy and short, maybe need to score it in a crescent next time and taper it more</li>
  <li>Again, baked for 20 mins w/steam, 28 minutes without. Put on parchment on a baking stone.</li>
  <li>Used a 9x9” glass pan with towels + the cast-iron bottom of the dutch oven + boiling water for steam
    <ul>
      <li>Not quite as dark as the boule, but also not burned on the bottom</li>
